2. Problems & Ethical Concerns

Privacy: AI systems collect personal data (risk of leaks/misuse).

Fairness: Biased algorithms can disadvantage learners.

Transparency: Many AI tools don’t explain how results are generated.

Integrity: Learners may misuse AI (cheating, plagiarism).

5. Consequences of Unethical Use

Loss of trust between learners, teachers, and institutions.

Data breaches exposing sensitive learner information.

Widening inequality if AI favours wealthier schools.

<hr>
<hr>
6. Solutions & Recommendations

Clear AI Policies: Schools should adopt UNESCO’s AI ethics guidelines.

Training & Awareness: Teachers and learners must understand how to use AI responsibly.

Transparency: Schools should only use AI systems that explain decisions clearly.

Privacy Protection: Strict data protection rules must be enforced.

Human Oversight: Teachers should always remain in control of assessment and decision-making.

Findings 
<hr>
<hr>
AI has the potential to revolutionise education by making learning more personalised and efficient. However, it also poses significant ethical risks if used carelessly.
<hr>
<hr>
Key findings:
<hr>
<hr>
AI is widely seen as beneficial but learners and teachers worry about privacy and fairness.

Lack of awareness and training is a major barrier to ethical use.

Ethical frameworks and guidelines are urgently needed in South African schools.
