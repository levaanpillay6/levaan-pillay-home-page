		<ul>
			<p><li>AI has become an essential tool in modern education. From personalised learning platforms to plagiarism detection software, AI is transforming how learners and teachers interact with information. However, without ethical use, AI poses risks such as data privacy violations, biased decision-making, and academic dishonesty.</li></p>
		</ul>

	<H2 align="center"<font face="Arial Black"><b><u>Task Definition</u></b></font></H2

		<ul>
			<p><li>The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in education has created opportunities for personalised learning, automated assessment, and access to global resources. However, the ethical use of AI in education is an important concern, as issues such as data privacy, transparency, fairness, and accountability affect learners, teachers, and institutions.</li></p>
			<p><li>This investigation focuses on how AI can be used ethically in the education sector in South Africa. The purpose is to explore both the positive and negative impacts of AI, the risks of unethical use, and how schools and universities can adopt clear policies and practices to ensure AI supports learning without harming students.</p></li>
			<p><li>The research will involve analysing secondary sources (articles, reports, websites), as well as gathering primary data through a questionnaire distributed to learners and teachers. The findings will be processed using spreadsheets (for numeric/statistical data) and a database (for categorical/qualitative data).</li></p>
			<p><li>The desired outcome is to recommend practical steps schools can implement to ensure AI is applied fairly, safely, and effectively. The target audience is school administrators, teachers, and learners who are stakeholders in ethical AI use in education.</li></p>
